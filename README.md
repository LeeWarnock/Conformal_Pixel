# Conformal_Pixel
## Example code for my conformal mapping script in Python.

To run this you will need to have the python library Pillow installed. It is the continuation of the Python Imaging Library (PIL). To install this library using `sudo -H pip install Pillow` on a \*nix system. On Windows, refer to the [Pillow website](https://python-pillow.org/) for instructions.

Once Pillow is installed, you can just run this script without arguments. All configuraiton happens inside of the main block of code at the bottom of the script. I have some example code placed there for your convenience in learning how the Conformal class works.

Have fun! If you make some cool patterns feel free to message me on reddit (/u/spel3o).

Go check out some of their brilliant work, and don't credit me for what they did. I only took their images and mathed them up.
